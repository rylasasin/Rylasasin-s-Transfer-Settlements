Institute scrap settlements work like this: They're essentially industrial settlements occupied entirely by robots or gen2 synths, meaning there's no need for residential plots.
They could theoretically be turned into legit settlements, but you will have to build some walls/domes and change some of the plots over to residential (especially the ones in the Red Rocket Monoliths.)
